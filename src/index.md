# Welcome to the OEB Prototype

This prototype uses the [Ontario Design System](https://designsystem.ontario.ca/) with 11ty as the static site generator. This code is not production quality and needs to be refactored by developer. That being said, everything should render as expected in accordance with the ODS system. Outside of tables (see below), all styles, colors, type, and components are rendered exactly as on the ODS.

_note on tables:_
ODS only has tables that use a slider to view. These tables have shown to be difficult for mobile users. The design makes use of truely responsive tables that stack in the mobile view. Both sized tables are in complete compliance with the table component but will need to use something like [CodePen Home
Responsive table (CSS ONLY)](https://codepen.io/ind88/pen/egNzOP) to function. Doing so aligns witht the custom component priniciples.
