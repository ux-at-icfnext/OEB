        - title: What is the Ontario Electricity Support Program?
          content: |
            The OESP is an Ontario Energy Board (OEB) program that lowers electricity bills for lower-income households. The OESP provides a monthly credit to eligible customers based on household income and household size. The OESP credits are applied directly to eligible customers’ bills.
        - title: When can I apply?
          content: |
            You can apply any time. There is no application deadline, but the sooner you apply and are accepted into the OESP, the sooner you will begin to receive the on-bill credits
        - title: When will I start seeing the on-bill credits?
          content: | 
            Applications take about 6 to 8 weeks to process. Credits don’t take effect until you submit all required information (including the signed consent form, if required) and your application is processed. The credit is applied to your utility bill as soon as possible after your application has been approved.
            Eligible customers will receive on-bill credits for two years regardless of when a customer applies and their credits begin. See "How do I Apply?"
            If you need assistance before the OESP credit is applied to your bill, please contact your electricity utility or visit the [OEB website](https://www.oeb.ca/rates-and-your-bill/help-low-income-consumers) for more information about other low-income programs that may be available to you.

        - title: What if I move?
          content: |
            Customers who move, or whose circumstances change, must re-apply.
        - title: I am already approved for OESP and received a notification from my utility to reapply. Why do I need to renew my OESP eligibility?
          content: |
            Approval for OESP credits is generally for a period of 2 years. Since circumstances may change over the years, consumers are required to [reapply](https://oesp.ca/Renew) every 2 years to make sure they are receiving the appropriate amount of OESP assistance.
        - title: Do I have to wait until my eligibility period is over to reapply?
          content: |
            No, you can [reapply](https://oesp.ca/Renew) anytime. We recommend reapplying a month or two before the end of your eligibility period.
        - title: Why do I have an OESP credit balance on my bill?
          content: |
            Electricity use can vary depending on the season. If your monthly OESP credit is larger than your utility bill, the credit rolls over to offset electricity costs in future months, such as heating during winter.
        - title: Can I get the rest of the OESP credit balance paid out?
          content: No, OESP credits have no cash value.

        - title: How is the OESP funded?
          content: |
            The OESP is funded by the provincial tax base.
        - title: Why was OESP eligibility expanded?
          content: |
            On March 1, 2024, the Ontario government expanded eligibility of the OESP by up to 35% so that more households will have access to the program, lowering their bills through on-bill credits. The new income eligibility thresholds for OESP reflects Canada’s 2020 Low-Income Measure (LIM). Note that the amounts listed are after income tax is deducted, potentially making more Ontarians eligible.
        - title: I’ll never use the program. Why am I paying for it?
          content: |
            For many lower-income Ontarians, paying their electricity bill can be a challenge. Electricity represents a significantly greater share of their monthly expenses. For households with an annual income of $20,000 a typical electricity bill could be 10 per cent or more of their income.

            **Consumer Tips**

            - Protect your personal information, your utility bill is private. It contains personal information like your account number and energy usage. Ensure there is a valid reason for disclosing this information (e.g., determining your eligibility) before doing so.
            - Remain vigilant and continue to use safe web browsing and email practices. Make sure you are accessing a safe and trusted source such as the utility’s website or call centre telephone number **exactly** as displayed on your bill.

            **Resources**
            Consumers concerned about any suspicious communications can also contact the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre or call [1-888-495-8501](callto:1-888-495-8501).
