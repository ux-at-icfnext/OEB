# Welcome to the OEB Prototype

This prototype uses the [Ontario Design System](https://designsystem.ontario.ca/) with 11ty as the static site generator. This code is not production quality and needs to be refactored by developer. That being said, everything should render as expected in accordance with the ODS system. All styles, colors, type, and components are rendered exactly as on the ODS.
